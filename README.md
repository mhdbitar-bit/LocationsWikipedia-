# LocationsWikipedia

* It's a simple App that fetches a list of locations and displays it at ** UITableView ** and if the user selects one of the presented locations it will navigate to the ** Wikipedia ** app and goes deeply to display the selected location inside of Map.

## Setup:

*  Clone the forked ** Wikipedia ** ios repository with the required changes. It can be found at:
- `https://github.com/mhdbitar-bit/wikipedia-iost`

* I made my changes in this branch: `feature/deeplinking`
